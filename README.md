# 🔍 Rock vs. Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to classify sonar signals received by a submarine as either **rock** or **mine**. The model is trained using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm — a simple yet powerful technique for binary classification.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Submarines use sonar signals to identify underwater objects. The signals reflected from rocks and mines differ in frequency and strength. By analyzing these sonar readings, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict whether the detected object is a **rock (R)** or a **mine (M)**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset contains **60 numeric features**, each representing the energy of sonar signals at a specific frequency.
- The target labels are:
  - `R` → Rock
  - `M` → Mine

## 🔧 Algorithms Used

- **Logistic Regression**  
  A linear model suitable for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability of a class using the logistic function.
